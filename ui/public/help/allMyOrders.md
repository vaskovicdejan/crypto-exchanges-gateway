It will display all open, completed & cancelled orders (_if cancelled orders are returned by exchange API_). For performance reason, on exchanges which only allow to retrieve orders for a single pair at once (such as _Binance_), orders will only be retrieved for _starred_ pairs to avoid spamming the exchange

TIPS:
* Click on any _PAIR_ value to open _Prices_ tab for this _pair_
* Click on any _RATE_ value to open _New Order_ tab using this _rate_
* If one of your order is currently partially filled, it's remaining quantity will appear in a distinct color
