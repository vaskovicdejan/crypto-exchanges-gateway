|Description

|interval
|string
|_depends on exchange_
|Klines interval (supported interval depends on exchange)

|fromTimestamp
|integer
|

|limit
|integer
|500
|Used to limit the number of results (will be ignored if _toTimestamp_ is set)

|===

[NOTE]
====
By default, only 500 points will be returned, using current timestamp for _toTimestamp_.
A maximum of 5000 points can be returned by service

|Name
|Type
|Description

|open
|float
|Open price (can be _null_ if there was no trade during the period)

|close
|float
|Close price (can be _null_ if there was no trade during the period)

|high
|float
|Highest price (can be _null_ if there was no trade during the period)

|low
|float
|Lowest price (can be _null_ if there was no trade during the period)

|volume
|float
|Volume (will be _0_ if there was no trade during the period)

|timestamp
|integer (unix timestamp sec)
|Unix timestamp

|remainingTime
|integer
|Indicates how many seconds are remaining before the end of the kline interval

|closed
|boolean
|Indicates whether or not kline can be considered as _closed_

|===

[NOTE]
====
_remainingTimestamp_ is just an indication and _volume_ can change even after _remainingTimestamp_ has reached _0_.
This is because some exchanges will only update kline _K1_ once the first trade for kline _K2_ has occurred.
_closed_ will be _true_ only once the kline has been finalized.
